for case of teams works we needs to use pylance (local development ) + pyright as ci tool 

Pylance local realtime coding stay in user settings. ruff should be in workspace settings not in user settings.

changes in settings.json is used to change editor behavior
for configuring ruff we can use pyproject.toml or ruff.toml

steps: 
1.add ruff as a uv add
2.install ruff in vs code 
3. install pylance (do some changes in user space setting vs code.)
4. adding ruff setup in workspace setting.

----
Setting Up Pre commits.
1. do uv add --dev pre-commit
2. then do pre-commit install  -> attach to git hooks.
Tells Git:

“Before every commit, run pre-commit hooks”

3. create .pre-commit-config.yaml file and add all the hooks here.
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.14.13
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff-check
      args: [ --fix ]  -- do not use fix may change the code 
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format



# do not use pytest and pyright in pre commit needs to use them in ci
#use uv sync to exactly replicate from lock file it will ignore dev dependencies 
uv sync --dev - for installing dev dependencies also
uv sync used to replicate the environment for new development setup 
and we needs to do both uv sync and uv sync --dev


# Learning about ci/cd  [Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment.]



Develop -> merger in branch -> Build stage -> Testing(Unit, Integration tes(are the different component working good together)), regression test(are the pld component work good with new component.) -> Release Stage[Deployment]

[Deployment Can be can be in 3 1 is dev env , stag env(end to end test), prod env]

CI[build and Test Stage Include]   CD[Deployment]

so from dev to staging will automatically done from staging to prod need approvement. then deploy if Continuous Delivery follow(approval of a person needed if follow Continuous Delivery) -> then deployment after permission 

but in Continuous Deployment from staging to prod automatically 
(it will dependent on Organization what they follow)

Github Action. we should follow
in summary 
- Build -> Test  --> deploy (staging) -> edge test()------>Manually Deploy (Delivery process) to Prod

- Build -> Test  --> deploy (staging) -> edge test()------>automatically Deploy (Deployment process) to Prod

Deployment Strategies do later.
1. Blue Green Deployment.
2. Canary Deployment
3. Rolling Deployment 



🧩 Why use Ruff + Pylance together?
🟣 Ruff → forces discipline

“Did you write a type?”

“Did you forget a return type?”

“Are imports sorted?”

“Is the code style consistent?”

🔵 Pylance → checks correctness

“Is this type actually correct?”

“Can this be None?”

“Are you misusing generics?”

“Will this crash at runtime?”

👉 One without the other is incomplete.
